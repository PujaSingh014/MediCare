Develop a healthcare recommendation system that analyzes user symptoms leveraging symptom data (using mock data), healthcare provider databases, and user ratings, recommends doctors with matching specialties and aligned schedules

## File Structure
<ul>
  <li>disease-prediction.ipynb is the jupyter notebook where data is analyzed and ml models are used for prediction.</li>
  <li>Training.csv contains training data</li>
  <li>Testing.csv contains testing data</li>
  <li>app - runs on Flask framework and utilizes the stored result from model to predict new data</li>
  <li>templates contain html files</li>
</ul>

## Models Used
<ul>
  <li> Logistic Regression </li>
  <li> Decision Tree Classifier</li>
  <li> Random Forest Classifier</li>
</ul>
